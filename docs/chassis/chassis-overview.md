# Chassis

**Chassis Type:** We used AndyMark’s AM14U5 chassis because it is a part of the Kit of Parts and is well tested and reliable. The included 6" rubber treaded wheels allow for easy traversing across the field and over the cable protector. The center wheel of the AM14U5 is dropped ⅛” lower than the other wheels, this will allow for static friction when turning side to side, thus making it easier to make micro adjustments when picking up or scoring game pieces.

**Chassis Size:** We picked the chassis size based on a few factors. Early on we decided to make the chassis as thin as possible to make sure the Everybot can form alliances with robots who were interested in fitting all 3 robots on the Charge Station. Having a thinner chassis will also allow for better maneuverability in the community zone, as we expect it to be a highly congested area. Additionally we decided to decrease the length of the chassis as well which allowed us to use the "square" AM14U5 wheel holes. This allows for slightly better turning, increasing precision with picking and placing game pieces.
