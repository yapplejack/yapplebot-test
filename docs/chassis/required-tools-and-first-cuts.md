# chassis Assembly

Required tools:

* 1/4" socket and ratchet (preferred) or flat blade screwdriver or bit

* 1/2" wrench

* 9/16" wrenches or sockets

* 7/16" or similar size socket

* 3/8" socket or ratchet

* 5/32" allen wrench or t-handle

* Bandsaw or chop saw

Adjustable wrenches can be used in place of the 9/16" and 1/2” wrenches

A cordless drill and 10-32 tap are optional but can make assembly faster and easier

![image alt text](/media/chassis/image_0.jpg)![image alt text](/media/chassis/image_1.jpg)![image alt text](/media/chassis/image_2.jpg)All required parts are from the AndyMark AM14U5 "K23" 2023 Kit of Parts chassis box except for four CIM (or CIM-replacement) motors. Two CIM motors are included in the standard Kit of Parts, with two additional CIMs included in the Rookie Kit of Parts. The chassis assembly section of the manual refers to Andymark part numbers, so keeping the Andymark manual open to the parts checklist may help you when following this manual. One NEO motor will be used elsewhere on the Everybot, so if you only have four NEOs do not use them on your drivetrain.

Before beginning to assemble the chassis, the two chassis End Plates will need to be cut down to 22" by removing 9” from one end. The chassis Inside and Outside Plates will all have 2” cut off of each end for a final length of 28”. The two 24” churros will need to be cut down to 13.25”. If the size of your team allows for it, have someone begin making these cuts while another group begins assembling the wheels. Measure out your cuts and mark them with a combination square to make sure your cuts are perpendicular and cut the plates in a bandsaw or chop saw, making sure to account for the width of your blade. Save all of these cutoff pieces for later.
