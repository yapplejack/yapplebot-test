# The Cut List

This manual will cross-reference the as much as possible when calling for parts. Printing the cut list is highly recommended. To try to make the cut list and our instructions make a little more sense, here is some of the method behind the madness:

* **Stock:** "stock" refers to raw material - it is the different “stuff” you are building the robot out of, like box tubing (of different dimensions), wood, or threaded rod. Each type of stock is color coded.

* **Part [.prt]:** this is the name of the individual CAD computer file with the 3D model and information for this specific part of the robot.

* **Quantity:** how many copies of this Part or "cut" you will need to make.

* **Length [in]:** the length, in inches, of the material that this Part uses. For most types of stock the dimensions of the stock make it obvious which direction this measurement is for - it would be hard to cut either the one or two inch dimensions of 2" x 1" 1/16" Wall Tubing to be 48.62 inches long, for example.

* **Width [in]: **what width to cut something to if appropriate, typically should only be used for polycarbonate sheets.

* **Note: **for your own usage.

* **Purpose:** which major component of the robot this piece is for. 

* **Total used [in]:** These measurements may help you lay out your cuts, but may also be a little confusing - don’t worry about them too much. If you make your cuts with the Quantity, Length [in], and Stick of each Part in mind they will work out.

* **Which stock to cut from (Sticks):** also referred to as "sticks," these are individual pieces of Stock with particular cuts in them. Use these to plan out your cuts on your raw Stock. Stick numbers restart with every new Stock - Stick 1 of the 1” by 1” 1/16th Wall Tubing is a different piece from Stick 1 of the 2" x 1" 1/16" Wall Tubing. The different lengths of each stock also have different stick numbers. We will use the part names to refer to pieces rather than stick numbers.

You should clearly label machined parts in a way that makes sense to your team. We recommend writing at least the Part names from the cut list, as that will make it obvious what part to grab when this manual refers to, for example, 02_Superstructure_Upright. Here are some examples of how you may want to label your parts from last year’s Everybot.
