# Navigating Our Resources

* This docs page is meant to be used alongside other resources that can be found on our [website](https://www.118everybot.org/)

    * [Bill of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FQiT3qv4sNFgAs3m7qzWLI2aqMw7r6ssJrI9GN3_Au0/edit?usp=sharing): all of the parts and stock that are needed to construct the Everybot can be found here. This does not include tools that may be required to machine or assemble the Everybot

    * [Cut List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13_pTHQV9YwcAtf3_clEg5P17Wjkwd5Gorz2NcEoRKRs/edit?usp=sharing): a spreadsheet that contains the length that all purchased stock must be cut to. It is recommended to cut and label all stock relevant to a given section before starting

    * [CAD](https://grabcad.com/library/the-2022-robonauts-everybot-2): a comprehensive 3D model of the robot, 

    * [Robot Code](https://gitlab.com/robonautseverybot/everybot-2023): the Everybot starter code gives the robot the capability to perform all actions showcased in the robot reveal but leaves plenty of room for improvement

    * Part Drawings (coming soon): all part drawings can be found at the top of each mechanism build section but are stored here as well for reference

    * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XuWfwRJcfA): join the Everybot community Discord to ask questions, share insight or celebrate achievements

* The immediately following sections of the manual are not instructions, but rather tips and suggested practices for best constructing your robot.

* The three main "Assembly" sections of the manual can be worked on in parallel. That is to say, if the size of your team allows for it, you can build any or all of these sections at the same time. The superstructure should be attached to the chassis before installing the arm and intake, but the actual assembly of each section as well as the chassis can be worked on at the same time.
