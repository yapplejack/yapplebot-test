# The Robonauts’ Everybot Robot Will…

When deciding what this year’s Everybot would be capable of we created an exhaustive list of actions that a Charged Up robot can perform and distilled that list into the Everybot capabilities. Some actions CAN be done by the robot but we will not put resources into having those capabilities as they are byproducts of the design we finished with. Below is the absolute "Robot Will" list.

In the Autonomous Period:

* Score a pre-loaded Cube or Cone

* Score Mobility points

* Dock on and Engage the Charge Station

In the Teleoperated Period:

* Score Cubes in the Bottom, Middle, and High Rows

* Score Cones in the Bottom, Middle, and High Rows

* Acquire Cubes and Cones from the Substations

* Play line-style defense in front the opponents loading zone while fully within its frame perimeter

* Dock on and Engage the Charge Station

The design was also driven by the goal of the Everybot being able to advance in the FIRST Robotics Competition, either to the District Championship in a District system or the World Championship in the Regional system. As our prototyping and design work carried on and our absolute "Robot Will" evolved into a physical robot and the Everybot started to take shape, we got a better idea of what match play would look like for the Everybot.
